#Measles #Immunization in #US #Schools (2017 - 2019)

As an integral part of public health initiatives, measles immunization plays a crucial role in safeguarding the well-being of children and communities across the United States. The #vaccination process is especially important in school settings, where large populations gather and interact.
Measles immunization in US schools is a critical component of public health efforts, protecting children and communities from the harmful consequences of this highly contagious disease.

With several key performance indicators such as #vaccination #coverage, immunization timeliness, vaccine exemption rates, and outbreak response preparedness, schools can assess the effectiveness of their immunization programs and work towards ensuring the health and well-being of their students.
